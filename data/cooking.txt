A well-prepared risotto showcases the art of cooking simple ingredients to perfection. Begin by gently saut√©ing onions in butter or olive oil until they become translucent. Next, add Arborio rice and toast it lightly before gradually adding warm broth, one ladle at a time. Continuous stirring helps the rice release its creamy starches. As the grains reach a tender but slightly firm texture, fold in grated Parmesan, season with salt and pepper, and finish with a pat of butter. The result is a rich, velvety dish that pairs beautifully with roasted vegetables or seafood.
