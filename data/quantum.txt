Quantum mechanics revolutionized our understanding of the microscopic world. Unlike classical particles, quantum entities such as electrons can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behaviors. Phenomena like quantum superposition suggest that particles can exist in multiple states at once, and the act of measurement often “collapses” these states into one observed outcome. This strange and counterintuitive theory underpins modern technologies like semiconductors and lasers, and it provides a conceptual framework for emerging fields like quantum computing and cryptography.
