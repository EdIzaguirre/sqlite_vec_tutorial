Exploring a new city on foot offers a more immersive travel experience. By strolling through local neighborhoods, you can observe the subtle details that define a place’s culture: the scent of freshly baked bread escaping from a corner bakery, the bright patterns of street art, the friendly nods exchanged between familiar neighbors. Small discoveries—like a hidden park, a family-run café serving homemade pastries, or a historic plaque you stumble upon—turn an ordinary trip into a memorable journey of personal connection and discovery.
