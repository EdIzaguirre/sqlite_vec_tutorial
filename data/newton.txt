In classical mechanics, Newton’s laws of motion form the foundation of how we understand the movement of objects. Newton’s first law, often called the law of inertia, states that an object at rest remains at rest and an object in motion continues in motion unless acted upon by an external force. This concept extends into more complex physics problems, where analyzing net forces on objects allows us to predict their future trajectories and behaviors. Over time, applying Newton’s laws has enabled engineers and scientists to design safer vehicles, more efficient machines, and even guide spacecraft through intricate gravitational fields.
