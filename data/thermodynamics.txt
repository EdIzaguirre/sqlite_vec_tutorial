In the study of thermodynamics, the second law states that the entropy of an isolated system never decreases over time. Essentially, entropy is a measure of disorder, and the universe’s tendency is to move from order to disorder. This principle has profound implications for energy conversion and efficiency: no engine can convert heat into work without losing some energy as waste heat. Understanding entropy not only shaped the design of more efficient machines but also influenced our comprehension of the “arrow of time” and the inevitable progression from structure to chaos.
