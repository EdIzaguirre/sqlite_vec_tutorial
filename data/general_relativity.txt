Einsteinâ€™s theory of general relativity redefined our understanding of gravity. Instead of viewing gravity as a force acting at a distance, it interprets it as the curvature of spacetime around massive objects. Light passing near a massive star bends slightly, galaxies deflect beams traveling millions of light-years, and clocks tick at different rates depending on their gravitational potential. This groundbreaking theory led to predictions like gravitational lensing and black holes, phenomena later confirmed by observational evidence, and it continues to guide our understanding of the cosmos.
